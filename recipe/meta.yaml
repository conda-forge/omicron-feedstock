  summary: An algorithm to detect and characterize transient events in gravitational-wave detectors
  description: |
    Omicron has been derived from a well-known 'burst-type' search pipeline
    called Q-pipeline (a.k.a Omega).  Q-pipeline is able to detect and
    characterize detector glitches with a very good efficiency and precision.
    So, the idea was to adapt it for detector characterization purposes,
    i.e. to run it over many auxiliary channels.  To achieve this, the
    original matlab code has been replaced by a C++ architecture and many
    steps have been removed to run faster.  The name Omicron was chosen to
    recall the Omega inheritance.
